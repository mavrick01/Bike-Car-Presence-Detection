# Bike-Car-Presence-Detection
Based from https://github.com/aderusha/MQTTCarPresence

I use this for our motorbikes (the cars have to live in the street)

I've added in my automation as I've not wanted it to open the garagedoor unless I've been running the bike for at least 10 minutes. Often we push the bikes out into the drive and then start them. I don't want the door to open as we drive away.

Dr ZZZs does a video with open and closing garage door. As we only exit from the main garage door and can control it from the phone, we avoid having timing issues with the door closing. I am thinking of using a motion sensor to detect if someone is in the garage before closing, but not got there yet.

This is Dr ZZZ's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DyblwsjfU8&t=296s
